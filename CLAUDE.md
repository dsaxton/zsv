# Project Guidelines

## Code Philosophy
- Keep things simple. When choosing between approaches, pick the one with fewer moving parts.
- Aim for elegance — code should feel clean and minimal, not bulky or over-built.
- Refactor while you're already in the code. Don't leave messes for a future cleanup pass.
- Maintain documentation (docstrings, docs files) alongside the code so knowledge doesn't evaporate between sessions.
- Let the code speak for itself. Avoid comments when good naming and structure make the intent obvious. When you're tempted to add a comment, see if restructuring the code would make it unnecessary.
